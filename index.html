				<h2>Browser tools</h2>

				<p>Browser tools have come a long way in the past few years, and they're pretty powerful tools now. Using the native tools built into your browser, you can test how your site performs on differently-sized screens, make quick changes to code and test them live, measure your site's performance, and debug issues more quickly.</p>

				<h2>Local development environments</h2>

				<p>If you want to really speed up your development time, you'll want to have a way to develop your sites locally. Investing some time in getting your local development

				<p>Benefits of developing your sites locally:
					<ul>
						<li>you're able to test all your changes before deploying them to your live production site</li>

						<li>you can build a website when you don't have an internet connection, or when you have a poor internet connection</li>

						<li>working locally is always faster, so you can make and test your changes more rapidly</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<p>What you need for your development environment will depend on what kind of site you're building and your development workflow. Ideally you want your local development environment to match your web server as closely as possible, so you'll be able to test in a similar environment.</p>

				<p>Many people start with a local server stack, which is a server that runs on your local machine. Common configurations are LAMP (Linux Apache MySQL PHP) WAMP (Windows Apache MySQL PHP) or MAMP (Mac Apache MySQL PHP), since this is also what many web servers use.</p>

				<p>You can also use a virtual machine. A virtual machine basically is an isolated part of your computer that acts as an independent computer. This means it has its own operating system that might be completely different from your computer's operating system. This can be helpful if you have a specific environment you'd like to test, but it can also eat up a lot of your computer's resources. VirtualBox is a popular open-source virtual machine, and you can use a provisioning tool like Vagrant to configure your virtual machine,</p>

				<p>You may also want to try specialised tools like Docker or Laravel Valet. It all depends on what you're looking for!</p>

					<h3 class="activity-card-title">Activity #1</h3>

					<p>Plan a local development environment to suit your needs.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>If your website is already hosted somewhere, find out as much as you can about the environment it's running on. (Server, technologies, versions, etc.)</li>
						<li>Now, think about what you're going to be developing. Write a list of everything you can think of that you'll need to be able to test and do.</li>
						<li>Make a note of your computer's limitationsâ€”operating system, memory, etc.</li>
						<li>Using all the information you've written down, choose a tool that suits your needs. For instance, if you need to test very specific technology setups, you'll want a virtual machine of some kind. If your needs are simpler, a local server stack may be a better choice.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="activity-card">
					<h3 class="activity-card-title">Activity #2</h3>

					<p>Set up a local development environment on your computer.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Start by installing the tool(s) you identified in activity #1.</li>
						<li>Set up a local clone of your website on your new local server. Depending on your platform there should be an automated way to import and export your data.</li>
						<li>Install a text editor of your choice so you can start developing code.</li>
					</ol>

			<section class="panel" id="starter-themes">
				<h2>Starter themes &amp; frameworks</h2>

				<p>Starter themes are a great way to get started building a new site quickly. No matter what CMS you use, there's a starter theme out there for you. Starter themes are usually relatively style-agnostic, so you aren't tied to a particular look and feel. They cover a lot of the basics, so you can jump into the fun part of customisation.</p>

				<p>What kind of basics? Well, all starter themes will include, at the very least, your basic HTML markup. They'll usually also contain all the special templates your CMS needs in a theme, as well as some special functionality to make your themeing experience easier.

				<p>Some will also have some CSS included: various resets and accessibility standards, sometimes some sensible defaults to get you started. Some will come with other tools like a build setup or sass sources. </p>

				<h3>What about frameworks?</h3>

				<p>Frameworks are a little bit different, because they often are quite opinionated about style. Depending on who's talking, a framework might be a full theme framework (like Genesis) or a CSS framework (like Bootstrap or Foundation). These can be great tools if you don't want a lot of control, or you want things to look good out of the box. If you want to customise things a bit more, you'll want to stick to starter themes.

				<h2>Git &amp; Github</h2>

				<p>Git is an open-source version control tool. It allows you to track every change to your code so you can easily roll back to prior versions when needed. Using a version control system makes it easier to collaborate with other contributors and means that you'll never lose your work again.</p>

				<p>Unlike other popular version control software, git is <em>distributed</em>, which means that instead of having a single place where version history is saved, each working copy of the code also has the full version history. This makes git much faster, and far easier to use on a poor or nonexistent internet connection.</p>

				<p>Github is a popular place to host your git repository, and it's extremely popular with maintainers of open-source projects. If you're contributing to open-source, you'll probably come across Github!</p>

				<h2>CSS Precompilers</h2>

				<p>Have you ever changed your mind in the middle of building a site and suddenly wanting to change all the colours? With a CSS precompiler, that's a thing you can do!</p>

				<p>Pre-processors extend CSS with variables, operators, interpolations, functions, and mixins in order to help you write more CSS code in less time. Learning to use them if you already know CSS is pretty simple, since they tend to follow a similar or identical structure to CSS. SCSS in particular is a great introduction, because you can write vanilla CSS as well.</p>

				<p>In order to use a CSS precompiler on your website, you'll need to compile your files: basically convert your code into CSS code. There are many automated tools that can do this for you, like <a href="http://koala-app.com/">Koala</a>. You can also write SCSS directly in your WordPress admin using the Jetpack plugin, or you can use a <a href="#task-runners">task runner</a> to compile your code as well as automating other tasks.</p>

					<p>Write your first bit of SCSS code.</p>

					<ol>
						<li>Fork this <a href="http://codepen.io/sarahmonster/pen/Ppwyee">Codepen</a> to start editing it yourself.</li>
						<li>Change the green colour used as the card header and for links by editing only a single line of SCSS.</li>
						<li>Change the width of the gutters used throughout.</li>
						<li>Use SCSS's nesting syntax to tweak the margins of the paragraph inside the card without affecting the paragraph outside the card.</li>
					</ol>
				</div>

				<div class="activity-card">
					<h3 class="activity-card-title">Activity #2</h3>

					<p>Ramp up your skills by writing your first mixin.</p>

					<ol>

						<li>Let's say you want to change the accent colour used in different types of cards. Write a mixin to easily apply the accent colour.</li>
						<li>For extra credit, look at the CSS that's generated by using your browser tools, or enter your code in <a href="http://www.sassmeister.com/">Sassmeister</a> to see the CSS output. You can also try installing a compiler to your laptop to work on code locally.</li>

				<h2>Task Runners</h2>

				<p>Task runners are command-line tools that take care of some of the automated tasks involved in building a website. Automating these tasks means you can worry about the important parts of building a site.</p>

				<p>Things task runners can do for you:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Compile CSS from your preprocessed source files.</li>
					<li>Add browser prefixes to CSS rules.</li>
					<li>Create SVG sprites for an icon system, and PNG fallbacks.</li>
					<li>Concatenante JS files.</li>
					<li>Lint your code for style.</li>
					<li>Optimise images.</li>
					<li>Refresh your browser when code changes.</li>

						<li><strong>Think about the things that slow you down most in your development process.</strong> Make a list of everything that takes a lot of time to do.</li>
						<li>Look through your list to see if any of those tasks can be automated.</li>
						<li>For instance, if you often find yourself manually refreshing your browser every time you update your code, you could look for a tool that would do this for you.</li>
						<li>Use Google to research the task you'd like to automate and find a tool that can help you.</li>

					<ol>
						<li>First, choose a task runner based on your needs. (I like <a href="http://gulpjs.com/">Gulp</a>.)</li>
						<li>You'll probably want to make sure Node and npm are installed on your machine first. <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">Here's how.</a></li>
